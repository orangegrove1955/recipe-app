# React Recipe API App

This is an introductory React app, created originally using `create-react-app`. The app uses the Edamam Recipe Search API to find recipes for a given search term, and provides a responsive grid view of the result.

The grid is built using CSS Grid techniques, and allows the user to click/tap on a card to view that recipe. The site is deployed using Netlify's inbuilt CI/CD functionality.
